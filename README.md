# O-Jogo-Das-Colunas-Coloridas
This algorithm and presentation, which earned an honorable mention at SIAC 2023, calculates the minimum number of moves required to solve any board configuration, and returns the moves in order. It features space optimization through a pre-processed BFS that only stores three layers of nodes, and information recovery via smaller BFS executions.
